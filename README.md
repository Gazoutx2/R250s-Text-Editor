-- This file is the "readme.txt" for R250's Text Editor Alpha 1.2.01 --

## The "Font" and "Light/Dark Mode" features are not working yet ##

This text editor has partly been made with OpenAI's ChatGPT (chat.openai.com).
It is currently being maintained and updated by Gazoutx2 (www.youtube.com/@Gazoutx2)/R250_Tv
(www.youtube.com/@R250_Tv). This software is open source, feel free to modify it however you want under one 
condition: do NOT sell any modified or original version of this project. 

To start it, you will need to have a recent installation of the Python runtime. To install Python, go to 
www.python.org. Once you have Python installed (and "pip" added to PATH) go in your Python terminal and type: 
"pip install PySimpleGUI" and run the "ALPHA 1.2.01.py" file. If you want to change the looks of the editor 
change the "theme" variable with any of the themes in the "Themes.png" file.

Please keep in mind this project is in the Alpha stage and there are some bugs.
